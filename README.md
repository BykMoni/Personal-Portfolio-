**Description (Task 2):**

**Task requirements:**

## ✅ How this project meets the brief

- **Single-page layout**: The portfolio is a single `index.html` file with in-page anchors (`#home`, `#projects`, `#contact`, `#experience`, `#skills`) so everything is accessible without navigation across multiple pages.
- **Sections included**:
  - **Introduction / Hero** — short bio, CTAs, and portrait.
  - **Projects** — cards summarizing projects with tags and links to code/demos.
  - **Contact** — email link and call-to-action; includes a certificate highlight card.
  - **Skills & Experience** — demonstrates relevant technologies and internship work.
- **Built with HTML & CSS**:
  - Semantic HTML5 elements are used for accessibility.
  - Plain CSS with CSS variables (custom colors), responsive grid/flex layouts, and subtle animations (hover lift, focus-visible).
- **Custom fonts & colors**: Google Fonts are included (Inter & Playfair Display) and color variables are defined in `css/styles.css`.
- **Animations**: Small, performant animations and transitions are used to enhance UI (card hover lift, focus outlines, nav toggle transitions), avoiding heavy JS or libraries.
